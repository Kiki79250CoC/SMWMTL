## ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Important Repo information !**
Q : **Why is this repo empty ?**

A : The source code isn't ready at all to be placed in a GitHub repo. Many major code modifications are required before it can be placed here.
:warning: However, the LTS version simply **cannot be placed in a repository** **due to code dependencies that will simply not be changed in the source code "Quebec"** (versions 2.1x one), even after the release of the next major release in the Stable branch. When version 2.20 is released, the source code of SMWMTL (Stable Branch) will be pushed to this repo.

‚ö†Ô∏è **HOWEVER !** ‚ö†Ô∏è The latest release is available in the Releases page.

# Super Mario World MultiTools Launcher (SMWMTL)
![AppBranding](https://github.com/Kiki79250CoC/SMWMTL/blob/139db41eb710da966650189d9e9b685ee0f4fb07/Releases/Images/AppBrand/AppBrandLogo.png)
Super Mario World MultiTools Launcher is a small program writted in VisualBasic.NET under Framework 4.0 (meanwhile, an upgrade to 4.6 is planned for next release), which allows to create Super Mario World Hacks more easily (if you use your own-dumped ROM) by grouping all tools in one place instead of travel into each folder to find what tool you want to use.

## Why SMWMTL ?

The actual problem with the Super Mario World hacking is the number of tools you need to use if yo want to make a good one. Each tool have his own functionalities, his ease to use that others don't have, ones are even for a very very VERY specific use. Choosing what tool to include in this Software is a pretty hard work. To respond to each user, the essential tools are available/included, and some variants of other tools was also included.

## UI Overview

SMWMTL's UI is very simple to use. The main page is divided in two categories.
The left one is the list of Application that SMWMTL can launch, and the right one is dedicated to eventual applications sub-menus (like as the Lunar Magic multi-version selector or AddMusicK's launch options.

The bottom zone is for some tools like Settings, Report bug form and some other features.

SMWMTL's UI is coherent betweet each windows, not like Windows 10 (^^) and eventually 11. Each Window have a simple design, buttons are on the bottom, and all infos on the space left.
